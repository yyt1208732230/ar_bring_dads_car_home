# The Background



#### **About the museum – The Great British Car Journey**

The GB Car Journey is a “huge garage” museum that contains over 150 classic cars and tells the success and fall of British industry to visitors (*Figure 1*). He is like an old-fashioned gentleman with mysterious stories, laid on the roadside of Ambergate, Derbyshire. Some of the cars still work today. We can book the driving experience or listen to their story with the provided digital guide.

There are several main parts of the museum, The Journey, Fill Station Café, Drive Dad’s Car Area, Workshop, and a big car parking. 

·    *The Journey*: is the main body of the “huge garage”, which displays 150+ classical cars with their own stories. The cars are categorised according to the events of their year born. Their story can be read by the floor-standing signs near them, and the signs have QR codes for scanning for a car characters and related documents.

·    *Fill Station Café*: is a rest area for visitors, especially classic car fans and families, providing food and bunches of souvenirs. This is where the **Bring Dad’s Car Home** AR experience design to be placed in.

·    *Drive Dad’s Car Area*: is a lane for driving the real classical cars. The driving experience is called Drive Dad’s Car [1], a trip down memory lane of classic British cars.

·    *Workshop*: is a classical car repairing workshop. We can visit how the senior engineer makes the 100 years old car work on the road.

·    *Car parking*: A big car park across the whole museum, either for visitor parking and holding car fans activity.

#### **The existing experience**

Our AR experience is designed based on “what they have”, so that the existing experiences in the museum are essential. The entire car journey is expecting comprise the existing experiences and *Bring Dad’s Car Home*. One of the existing experiences is the digital handheld kit (*Figure 2*). Audio and slides on the kit are played by subjectively clicking the specific chapter when you visit a display area. Scanning QR code on the standing sign beside a car can read the story and the characters of the car. This experience we called *The Car Journey*. The other existing experience is driving the real old car with families, which they called Drive Dad’s Car [1] (*Figure 3*). Watch the car history, smell, and drive a real car back to those days, and then, should bring a car we can afford back to home, of course, know this car is a prerequisite.

#### **A webcam AR experience - Bring Dad’s Car Home** 

Bring Dad’s Car Home is a webcam-based AR experience designed for family-based visitors and classic car fans by using the coasters to DIY a digital car. The players can only get the special or episodic decorated elements in the museum. After the players customize their digital cars, they can bring them home and enjoy their unique artworks whenever they want through a webcam of their own devices.

#### **Differences**

Except aiming bring profits to the café and a complete classic car experience, there are 3 key reasons you can take the project.

·    Easy to play: Only few steps to engage in the experience, even older visitors can join!

·    Simple implementation: Stakeholders can only provide a few supports to implement the experience wherever they want.

Creative mixed reality boundary: Your coaster is a unique digital car in the virtual world and a real thing (or a gift) you can use daily.

#### **The storyboard**

Here is a story about how Bring Dad’s Car Home AR experience became the biggest gift for a kid, Sophia. Sophia visited the Great British Car Journey with her parents at the weekend. (*Figure 7*)
