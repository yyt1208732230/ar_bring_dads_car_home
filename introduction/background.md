# The Background



#### **About the museum – The Great British Car Journey**

The GB Car Journey is a “huge garage” museum that contains over 150 classic cars and tells the success and fall of British industry to visitors (*Figure 1*). He is like an old-fashioned gentleman with mysterious stories, laid on the roadside of Ambergate, Derbyshire. Some of the cars still work today. We can book the driving experience or listen to their story with the provided digital guide.

There are several main parts of the museum, The Journey, Fill Station Café, Drive Dad’s Car Area, Workshop, and a big car parking. 

·    *The Journey*: is the main body of the “huge garage”, which displays 150+ classical cars with their own stories. The cars are categorised according to the events of their year born. Their story can be read by the floor-standing signs near them, and the signs have QR codes for scanning for a car characters and related documents.

·    *Fill Station Café*: is a rest area for visitors, especially classic car fans and families, providing food and bunches of souvenirs. This is where the **Bring Dad’s Car Home** AR experience design to be placed in.

·    *Drive Dad’s Car Area*: is a lane for driving the real classical cars. The driving experience is called Drive Dad’s Car [1], a trip down memory lane of classic British cars.

·    *Workshop*: is a classical car repairing workshop. We can visit how the senior engineer makes the 100 years old car work on the road.

·    *Car parking*: A big car park across the whole museum, either for visitor parking and holding car fans activity.
