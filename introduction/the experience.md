#### **A webcam AR experience - Bring Dad’s Car Home** 

Bring Dad’s Car Home is a webcam-based AR experience designed for family-based visitors and classic car fans by using the coasters to DIY a digital car. The players can only get the special or episodic decorated elements in the museum. After the players customize their digital cars, they can bring them home and enjoy their unique artworks whenever they want through a webcam of their own devices.

#### **Differences**

Except aiming bring profits to the café and a complete classic car experience, there are 3 key reasons you can take the project.

·    Easy to play: Only few steps to engage in the experience, even older visitors can join!

·    Simple implementation: Stakeholders can only provide a few supports to implement the experience wherever they want.

Creative mixed reality boundary: Your coaster is a unique digital car in the virtual world and a real thing (or a gift) you can use daily.

#### **The storyboard**

Here is a story about how Bring Dad’s Car Home AR experience became the biggest gift for a kid, Sophia. Sophia visited the Great British Car Journey with her parents at the weekend. (*Figure 7*)
